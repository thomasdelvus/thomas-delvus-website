# Saffrondale (Town Adventure)

## Description: 
Nestled in the heart of a lush landscape, Saffrondale emerges as the pinnacle of prosperity and charm at the beginning of summer. This historic market town, renowned for its vibrant saffron trade, buzzes with energy as traders from distant lands converge in its bustling marketplace. Saffrondale's saffron, valued thrice that of gold by weight, paints the town with hues of ambition and secrecy. Farmers, fiercely protective of their "red-gold," cultivate the precious crocuses in concealed plots, guarding their locations zealously. Transactions in saffron not only symbolize wealth but also offer the savvy an edge in bargaining, turning the market into a lively tapestry of commerce and intrigue.
The landscape around Saffrondale is as diverse as its populace. To the north, the serene fens stretch towards the horizon, hinting at the capital city's distant spires. Forests cloak the south and east, offering shelter and mystery with their ancient boughs. To the west, a grand noble house stands as a testament to the region's affluent ruling family, overseeing the town's prosperity.

## Details:
Saffrondale is now the land's premier market for Saffron, which is worth 3x that of gold (by weight).
Farmers are very protective of this "red-gold" and grow saffron is hidden places.
Paying in saffron can yield better pricing.
The Market is very lively (on weekdays) with traders coming from far away and staying in the Inns.

## Scale:
The town is only about 200x200m.  Bounded by the 4 major roads: High Street (W), Castle Street (N), Common Hill (E) and George Street (S).
Movement within the town is fairly quick and easy.
The town slopes upward as you proceed North East, downward as you proceed South West. About a 50 foot difference in elevation.
The Temple and Castle Ruins are at the top of the hill, which then levels off as you head North or East.

## Streets:
- High Street: runs North to South along the West side of the town, acting as the western boundary. It is a major road that vertically frames the left side of the town, Castle Street in the North down to George Street in the South.
- Common Hill: also runs north to south but on the east side of the town, parallel to High Street. This road serves as the eastern boundary of the town, framing the right side from Castle Street down to George Street.
- George Street: is located at the southernmost part of the town, running west to east. It connects the ends of High Street and Common Hill at the bottom, serving as the southern boundary of the town.
- Castle Street: runs west to east at the northernmost part of the town, opposite to George Street. It connects High Street and Common Hill at the top, marking the northern boundary of the town.
- Temple Street: is parallel to and directly south of Castle Street, running west to east. It spans between High Street and Common Hill, creating a line of demarcation within the town.
- King Street: is located south of Temple Street, also running west to east. It further divides the town and intersects with a notable area called Market Hill, leading to a central point known as Market Square.
- The Rows: is situated south of King Street, running west to east between but not as far as High Street and Common Hill.
