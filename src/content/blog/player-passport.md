# The Player Passport  
*A safer way to carry your characters through a living world*

One of the quieter problems in tabletop gaming—especially when it crosses into digital space—is identity.

Characters are meant to be shared.  
Stories are meant to be retold.  
But *control*—who can act on behalf of a player—must remain singular.

The Player Passport exists to solve that tension.

## The Problem with Accounts

Most online games begin with an account system: usernames, passwords, recovery emails, and databases full of information no one actually wants to manage. For a small, experimental world like Saffrondale, this approach felt wrong. Heavy. Fragile. And unnecessary.

Players don’t need *accounts*.  
They need *continuity*.

They need a way to return to their characters, campaigns, and history—without turning a fantasy world into a compliance exercise.

## What the Passport Is

The Player Passport is a **single bearer credential**. Possession equals authority.

It grants access to:
- All characters owned by that player
- All campaigns they are part of
- The ability to continue play exactly where they left off

There are two ways to use it:

1. **Scan the QR code**  
   This takes the player directly into the game, already authenticated.

2. **Manual entry**  
   The Passport Key can be copied and pasted into the game interface to authenticate explicitly.

No usernames.  
No passwords.  
No email addresses.  

Just a key.

## What the Passport Is *Not*

The Passport is **not** a character sheet.

Character sheets are *meant* to be shared:
- Posted on blogs
- Sent to friends
- Passed around tables
- Archived as story artifacts

They describe a character.

The Passport, by contrast, describes *authority*.

Anyone who possesses it can act on the player’s behalf. That makes it closer to a private key than a profile. Which leads to a very simple rule:

> **Character sheets may be shared. Player Passports must not be.**

This is why the example Passport shown here has its QR code, key, and passport number deliberately obscured.

## Why This Is Safer Than It Looks

At first glance, bearer keys feel risky. In practice, they dramatically reduce the attack surface.

- There is no personal data to steal  
- There are no passwords to reuse or reset  
- There is nothing to phish  
- There is nothing to recover  

Lose the Passport, and access is lost—just like losing a physical object. That tradeoff is intentional. It mirrors how tabletop play already works: if you lose your character sheet, the world does not owe you a backup.

For players who care about persistence, the Passport *is* the thing to protect.

## A Physical Metaphor for a Digital World

The design is intentionally diegetic.

This is not a token hidden in a database. It is a document. Something you can imagine keeping in a satchel, tucked into a book, or locked in a drawer. It fits the world because it behaves like an object *within* it.

Saffrondale is built around the idea that artifacts matter. Maps are canonical. Locations persist. Actions leave scars.

The Player Passport is simply another artifact—one that lives half in the fiction, half in the machinery that supports it.

And like all such artifacts, it works best when treated with respect.

Store it securely.  
Do not distribute it.  
And if you choose to step back into the world later, it will still be waiting.
