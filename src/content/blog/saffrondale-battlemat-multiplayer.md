Progress update on Saffrondale: I am building the battlemat to support real multiplayer sessions. The core pieces in motion right now are shared state, character sheets, a player dashboard, and "player passports" for lightweight authentication and session access.

The goal is simple: let players log in, see their own character and notes, and join a live table without breaking the world rules or continuity. That means the maps, locations, and rules stay canonical, while player identity stays consistent across sessions.

Next steps are tightening the flow between the battlemat and dashboards, and making the passport system smooth enough that it fades into the background.
