Some character sheets record numbers.  
This one records *intent* - and does it with strict respect for the rules.

Seraphina Ashveil began the same way most 5e characters do: a first-level wizard, a sage, a half-elf with a bias toward study and persuasion. Nothing exotic. The difference is how her sheet *communicates* that reality, quickly and honestly.

## From Rules to Presence

The foundation is entirely orthodox. Every value on the sheet obeys 5e:

- Ability scores are explicit and visible  
- Proficiency and saving throws are derived, not implied  
- Attacks list real ranges, damage, and types  
- No hidden bonuses, no narrative exceptions  

This matters because constraint is the pressure that reveals story. The rules do the work. We don’t editorialize them.

## A Sheet That Communicates at a Glance

The design goal was clarity without sterility. The layout is optimized for "table glance" use: what a DM or player needs in five seconds.

Each section of the sheet answers a single question:

- **Abilities:** What kind of mind and body does this character inhabit?  
- **Combat:** How fragile is she, really?  
- **Capabilities:** Where does competence actually live?  
- **Appearance:** Who stands in front of you when the numbers fall away?  

The visual hierarchy mirrors how a DM reads a character in play: name, core stats, combat survivability, then tools and narrative. Nothing competes for attention. Nothing is decorative without purpose.

This is not UI for a video game. It is a player-facing artifact meant to survive table use, narration, and memory. It is also designed to print cleanly: the PDF output preserves layout proportions, page breaks, and legibility.

## Seraphina Ashveil, Revealed

Seraphina is not powerful - yet. Seven hit points make that abundantly clear. Her strength is negligible. Her armor nonexistent.

What she *does* have is focus.

High Intelligence and Charisma point toward a character whose influence will not come from force, but from understanding - of arcane systems, of people, of history. Skills are not scattershot; they cluster around investigation, knowledge, and persuasion. This is someone who uncovers, not conquers.

Even the equipment choices reinforce restraint. Nothing exotic. Nothing magical. Just enough to survive the early chapters.

The portrait completes the loop: not as wish fulfillment, but as confirmation. This is what the numbers were implying all along.

## Why This Matters

A character sheet like this does something subtle but important: it *respects the future*.

It does not assume heroism.  
It does not pre-write destiny.  
It leaves room for consequence.

In Saffrondale, characters are not protected by narrative convenience. They persist - or fail - according to the same rules every time. A sheet that clearly exposes weakness is not a liability; it is an invitation to meaningful play.

Seraphina Ashveil is not yet a legend.

She is something better.

She is **possible**.
