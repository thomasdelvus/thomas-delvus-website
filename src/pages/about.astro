	<p>Thomas Delvus builds worlds where stories are not merely told, but uncovered.</p>

	<p>
		The work here treats narrative as a system: geography matters, rules persist, and choices leave
		residue. Meaning is not delivered; it is earned through interaction with structures that resist
		simplification. Whether fictional or analytical, each project is designed to be explored rather
		than explained.
	</p>

	<p>
		At the center is <strong>The Watchers</strong>, a modern myth unfolding across forms, concerned
		less with spectacle than with aftermath—power that hides in plain sight, and the quiet machinery
		beneath belief and progress.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alongside it is <strong>Saffrondale</strong>, a living fantasy world run through an AI-assisted
		Dungeon Master. It is not improvised fiction, but a constrained environment: canonical maps,
		stable rules, and player-facing artifacts that remain consistent across sessions. Stories emerge
		from consequence, not script.
	</p>

	<p>
		A third thread runs through the workshop in the form of AI-generated conversations and podcasts
		on science, finance, and emerging ideas. These are not commentary pieces, but experiments in
		structured thought—designed to surface assumptions, stress-test models, and make hidden systems
		visible.
	</p>

	<p>
		Artificial intelligence is used here as an instrument, not an oracle. Its role is to enforce
		continuity, preserve state, and operate within clearly defined constraints. The human work lies
		in designing the frame: the rules, invariants, and boundaries that make coherence possible.
	</p>

	<p>
		Together, these projects form a single pursuit: the construction of worlds—imagined and
		analytical—where systems are legible, truth is indirect, and discovery is left to the
		participant.
